# firebase_chai_spike
a Spike to experiment with using Chai for Feature and Unit tests for Firebase.

Current objective: build the basic firebase app from here https://github.com/Yorkshireman/firebase_spike into this app. Then, get firebase-server going (https://github.com/urish/firebase-server) - see blog post link in it also - so that when you run the app in development, the real firebase database doesn't get hit.

Then get testing going on it - ideally feature tests.
